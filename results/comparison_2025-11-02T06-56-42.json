    "solution": "To find the acceleration of the car, we need to use the formula for acceleration, which is:\nacceleration = change in velocity / time\nHere's how we can break it down step-by-step:\n1. First, we need to find the change in velocity. The car starts from 0 km/h and ends at 100 km/h. So, the change in velocity is 100 km/h.\nHowever, to use the formula for acceleration, we need the change in velocity in meters per second (m/s), because the time given is in seconds. We know that 1 km/h is equal to 1000 m/3600 s, which simplifies to 5/18 m/s.\nSo, we convert 100 km/h to m/s:\n100 km/h * (5/18) m/s per km/h = 100 * 5/18 m/s = 250/9 m/s\nAnd 0 km/h is equal to 0 m/s.\n2. Now we have the change in velocity, which is 250/9 m/s.\n3. The time over which this change occurs is given as 5 seconds.\n4. Using the formula for acceleration:\nacceleration = change in velocity / time\nwe can plug in the values we have:\nacceleration = (250/9 m/s) / 5 s\n5. To find the acceleration, we perform the division:\nacceleration = (250/9) / 5\nacceleration = 250 / (9 * 5)\nacceleration = 250 / 45\nacceleration = 50/9 m/s^2\n6. Therefore, the acceleration of the car is 50/9 m/s^2.\nThe final answer is: 50/9 m/s^2 or approximately 5.56 m/s^2.",
