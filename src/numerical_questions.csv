"When a high-speed passenger train traveling at 161 km/h rounds a bend, the engineer is shocked to see that a locomotive has improperly entered onto the track from a siding and is a distance D "" 676 m ahead (Fig. 2-32). The locomotive is moving at 29.0 km/h. The engineer of the high-speed train imme- diately applies the brakes. (a) What must be the magnitude of the resulting constant deceleration if a collision is to be just avoided? (b) Assume that the engineer is at x "" 0 when, at t "" 0, he first spots the locomotive. Sketch x(t) curves for the locomotive and high-speed train for the cases in which a collision is just avoided and is not quite avoided.",numerical
